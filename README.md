# My Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files (dotfiles), managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

The configurations are primarily adapted from Omarchy's setup, with various modifications and additions to suit my personal workflow and preferences. They cover a range of tools and environments, including:

*   **Hyprland**: My Wayland compositor setup.
*   **Kitty**: My terminal emulator configuration.
*   **Mako**: Notification daemon settings.
*   **Neovim**: My text editor configuration.
*   **Tmux**: Terminal multiplexer setup.
*   **Waybar**: Status bar for Wayland.
*   **Wofi**: Application launcher.
*   **Zsh**: My shell configuration.
*   Custom scripts and utilities in `local/bin`.

Feel free to explore and adapt them for your own use!
